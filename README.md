## What is Lox?

Lox is a Dynamically Typed Programming Language created by [Bob Nystrom](https://twitter.com/intent/user?screen_name=munificentbob) for his excellent book [Crafting Interpreters](https://craftinginterpreters.com).

## What is Lox Language
This is a simple syntax-highlighting module for `.lox` files. It doesn't contain snippets, autocomplete, error highlighting or anything fancy like that.

If you want an implementation of the Lox language, the source for Bob Nystrom's initial Java implementation, "jlox" is located [here](https://github.com/munificent/craftinginterpreters), and if you want a Javascript implementation that can be run in your browser, I recommend you try [YALI.js](https://github.com/danman113/YALI.js), my implementation of the Lox language.

## Build Instructions

To build, navigate to the root directory and run `vsce package`. This will create a `.vsix` file which can be imported to VSCode.
